# Title

Roll your own Type class

# Description

One of the goals of Functional Programming is capturing side effects
and pushing them to the borders of a program so our core logic can be
pure. In this talk, we will take a look how we can utilise Type
Classes to help us achieve this goal. We will also discuss how their
use inevitably leads to improvements in overall type safety of our
programs.
